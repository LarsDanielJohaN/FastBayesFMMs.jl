# README FastBayesFMMs.jl

This package provides a Julia implementation of the Fast Longitudinal Function on Scalar Regression (FLFOSR) created by Thomas Sun and Dan Kowal. The model is a form of Functional Mixed Model whose components are estimated using a Bayesian perspective, hence the name FastBayesFMMs.
